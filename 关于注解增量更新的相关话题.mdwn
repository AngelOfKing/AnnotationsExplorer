Starting with Gradle 2.1, it is possible to compile Java incrementally. 

Starting with Gradle 4.7, the incremental compiler also supports incremental annotation processing. Annotation processors need to opt in to this feature, otherwise they will trigger a full recompilation.

 Gradle 4.8 goes farther by making it possibly dynamic by making an annotation processor incremental.
